Big O Notation:

It is a Mathematical notation which is used to determine the time and space complexity of an algorithm for a given input n.
It gives the upper bound of an algorithm i.e the maximum space and time complexity of an algorithm

it is denoted by - O(f(n)).
Ex : the time complexity of a binary search algorithm is O(log(n)).
