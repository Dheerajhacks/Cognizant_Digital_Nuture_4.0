Out of the two searches - linear search and binary search.

binary search is effecient in searching the products as the quantity will be large.

Linear search uses O(n) time. It is easy to implement. It works fine with small datasets.

Binary search takes O(log(n)) to sort the array +  O(log(n)) to search. 
When search queries are more.. binary search effeciently finds the element.
However it is a bit complex to implement as compared to linear search.
