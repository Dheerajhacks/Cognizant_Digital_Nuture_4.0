The most commonly used search algorithms are linear search and binary search

For linear search:- 

Best case - O(1) -- if the element is present in the first position
Average case - O(n)
Worst case - O(n)


For binary search:-
Best case - O(1) -- if the element is present at the middle
Average case - O(log(n))
Worst case - O(log(n))
