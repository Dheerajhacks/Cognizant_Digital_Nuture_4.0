Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself until the base condition is reached.
It is used to solve repeated sub problems

Recursion helps us to focus and logic instead of handling the loops and stack logic.
It internally uses stack data structure.


Time conplexity :-

In hte code... each recursive call executes an instruction so, the time complexity will be O(1). 
As the function calls itself upto n yeas so it executes for n(years) times.
The time complexity will be O(n) for the code

Optimization:-

The recursive call can optimized by using - for loop.
