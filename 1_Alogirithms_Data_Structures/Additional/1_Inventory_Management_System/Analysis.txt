In a Inventory management System there are different operations like finding a product, adding, deleteing etc.
By using correct data structures we can reduce the time complexity of each case.

For this problem we can use ArrayList, HashMap, TreeMap.

Analysis:-
			HashMap		ArrayList

Add			O(1)			O(1)
Delete		O(1)			O(n)
Update		O(1)			O(n)
Traverse		O(n)			O(n)
