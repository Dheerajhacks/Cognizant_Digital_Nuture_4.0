About git ignore
.gitignore is a text file in the repository that tells Git which files or folders to ignore.
THe files that are added in it are ignored, and are not tracked.

How it works
The .gitignore file contains patterns.
When a command git status or git add is run, Git checks each file against these patterns.
If a file matches a pattern and is not already tracked, Git ignores it.
